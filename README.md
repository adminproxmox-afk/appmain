# Skill Play Web App

The project uses a plain static structure on `HTML/CSS/vanilla JS`.
The main app lives in the root files and folders: `index.html`, `js`, `pages`, `style`, and `data`.

## Main pages

- [index.html](/E:/app/web/app/index.html)
- [login.html](/E:/app/web/app/login.html)
- [regist.html](/E:/app/web/app/regist.html)
- [pages/shop.html](/E:/app/web/app/pages/shop.html)
- [pages/character.html](/E:/app/web/app/pages/character.html)
- [pages/setting.html](/E:/app/web/app/pages/setting.html)

## Deployment

- GitHub Pages is published from [.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml](/E:/app/web/app/.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml)
- the workflow uploads the root static site directly
- no React build step is required

## Enhancement layer

The vanilla site now uses CDN-based libraries for richer UX without switching to a framework:

- `GSAP + ScrollTrigger` for entrance and scroll-driven motion
- `Swiper` for touch-friendly carousels on the home screen
- `Howler.js` for interface sounds and ambient audio based on user settings
